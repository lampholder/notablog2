<em>He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away. ~Raymond Hull</em>
<p>I guess it was with this spirit in mind that my friend Oddvar, saddened by my efforts to 'trim' some of the more colourful words from my vocabulary, engineered the antidote to my <a href="http://b.3cu.eu/entries/I_swear_too_much.entry">swear filter</a> over on <a href="http://notablog.oddvar.org">his very own not blog</a>.</p>
<em>Oddvar, you shit-eating anusmaster</em>
<p>I was rather hoping Oddvar's blog scraped mine directly; I was all set to deploy my <a href="?f=oddvar">noun-to-Oddvar</a> natural language processing filter for hits from his IP.</p>
